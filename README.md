## About the Project

The Overwatch 2 Counter Picks Calculator is designed to help players make informed decisions in their game strategy, potentially increasing their chances of winning matches. The tool is constantly updated to reflect the latest game meta and hero balances, ensuring its recommendations remain relevant and effective.

## Features

- **Counter Pick Suggestions**: Analyzes the enemy team's composition and suggests the most effective counter picks using a score rating.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Offers real-time suggestions based on the current meta and hero effectiveness.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for quick and efficient strategy planning.

## How To Use It

1. **Select the Enemy Team Composition**: Use the dropdown selectors to input the enemy team's hero choices.
2. **Select role**: Use the 'Select Role' dropdown to select what role you wish to see counters for
3. **Calculate Counter Picks**: Click the "Calculate" button to generate a list of recommended counter picks.
4. **Adjust Your Strategy**: Use the provided suggestions to adjust your team's composition for a strategic advantage.

## How It Works

- Each Overwatch hero has a list of tank, damage, and support counters
- Based on the users input of the enemys team comp, the program counts how many times a character appears on the selected enemy heroes counter lists, each time a character appears on a counter list, a point is awarded to that character.
- The program then searches through the current counter list and checks if any of the counter picks can be countered by one of the enemy heroes, if so, a point is deducted. This helps to ensure a more accurate recommendation of counter picks

## Future Plans and Improvements

- Add a page which shows an icon for each Overwatch hero, clicking on a hero then highlights all recommended counters for that one hero.

- The biggest improvement I would like to make is to the collection of data, most of the data for this project is gathered from [ggrecon.com](https://www.ggrecon.com/guides/overwatch-2-counter-list-all-heroes/) and independant research. However, I would like to create a google form where players can input their opinions on best counters. This would help create a wide range of opinions and help garner a more accurate and up to date list of hero counters. if you would like to fill out this google form and contribute to the data being analyzed in the future update you can fill it out [here](https://forms.gle/VznpiG42mV7sHtKo8)
